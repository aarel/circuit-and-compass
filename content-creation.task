Restate + clarify scope
You want to build a small content business by writing SEO-optimized blog posts for two niches (tech + one lifestyle niche), using AI for keyword research and drafts, then monetizing via freelancing and/or ad/affiliate revenue over time.

Side hustle summary (3–5 bullets)

Who it serves: Readers and clients in a specific tech niche plus one lifestyle niche (e.g., productivity, remote work, fitness, money, etc.).

Core value: Clear, useful, SEO-aware articles that answer specific search intents and build topical authority.

How money is made: Freelance article fees ($50–$200+/article) plus slow-build ad or affiliate revenue on owned content.

Your role: Solo creator/editor who uses AI for clustering/outlines/drafts but owns final voice, structure, and fact-checking.

Constraints: Budget under $150 for domain/hosting; 5–10 hours per post; ROI expected over 6–12 months in an oversaturated space.

Assumptions (model, audience, monetization)

Model

You’ll start with a single authority-style blog/brand that can host both tech and lifestyle content under one umbrella, with clear category separation.

Risk: [Moderate] – Might need tighter focus (e.g., “tech careers + veteran lifestyle”) to avoid diluted SEO signals.

Offer ladder:

Publish your own posts (for portfolio + SEO).

Pitch/blog for-hire services to companies and solopreneurs in your chosen niches.

Risk: [Low] – Standard progression for writers.

Audience

Organic readers: People searching Google for specific problems within your chosen tech + lifestyle topics.

Risk: [Moderate] – SEO is long-tail and slow; needs consistent publishing and good topic selection.

Paying clients: Content managers, founders, or marketers who need niche articles and care about accuracy and tone.

Risk: [Low] – This audience exists; main challenge is standing out and reaching them.

Monetization

Short/medium term: Freelance per-article or per-project fees ($50–$200/article), anchored by portfolio pieces on your blog and Medium.

Risk: [Moderate] – Rates may start lower while you build proof and relationships.

Long term: Ad/affiliate revenue from your blog once you have enough traffic.

Risk: [High] – Traffic thresholds are non-trivial; payout is slow and uncertain.

Decide if software is needed and what kind

Software required? → Optional for starting, recommended for long-term leverage.

Justification:
You can begin with Medium alone to validate topics and writing cadence, but owning a simple, fast blog on your own domain is important for long-term SEO, portfolio control, and client perception.

If run as pure process (no custom build):

Use Medium + a simple About/profile page.

Track keywords/topics in a spreadsheet or Notion database.

Use AI tools (ChatGPT/Claude) plus something like Google Keyword Planner or free SEO tools via browser.

If software is leveraged (recommended):
Primary artifact: SEO-focused personal blog / authority site on your own domain.

Why this artifact first:

Gives you a controlled, fast-loading home for your content with proper structure (categories, internal links, schema later).

Acts as a portfolio hub for pitching freelance work with specific samples for each niche.

Future-proof: you can add email capture, lead magnets, and service pages without migrating platforms.

Best-fit code base / stack

Project type

“Content-focused blog / authority site with basic SEO structure.”

Tech stack

Frontend: Static site using Astro or Next.js, with Markdown/MDX-based posts and Tailwind CSS for styling.

Backend: None (static generation) or minimal serverless (only if needed later for forms).

Data layer: Markdown/MDX files in the repo for posts + simple config (tags, categories, metadata); no DB needed initially.

Infra / 3rd-party:

Hosting: Vercel or Netlify for static deployment.

Analytics: Simple privacy-friendly analytics (e.g., Plausible/Umami) or Google Analytics.

Optional: Simple form provider (Formspree/Getform) if/when you add a “hire me” page or newsletter.

Rationale

Fast to ship: Astro/Next + Markdown makes it easy to get a blog live with just a few templates and content files.

SEO-friendly: Static pages, good performance, and full control over metadata, URLs, and structure.

Low cost: Free-tier hosting and zero database costs fit under your <$150 budget with room for domain + optional analytics.

Learning value: Reinforces modern frontend concepts plus content-driven site patterns, while staying maintainable.

Extensible: Easy to add categories, tags, author pages, and simple service/portfolio pages without changing stack.

Project names (3–5 options)
(Assuming tech + a broad lifestyle lens like careers/productivity; you can refine once you pick the lifestyle niche.)

Critical validation questions

Which specific tech niche (e.g., dev tools, AI/LLMs, security, telco, etc.) and which specific lifestyle niche (e.g., veteran life, remote work, money habits, productivity) do you want to commit to for the first 6–12 months?

Do you want to start on Medium-only for the first 3 posts, or launch the Astro/Next blog immediately and cross-post to Medium?

Is your primary near-term goal to attract freelance clients, or to build long-term SEO/ad/affiliate income from the blog itself?

Are you comfortable managing posts as Markdown/MDX in a repo, or do you prefer a more traditional CMS-like editing experience (e.g., headless CMS) even at the cost of extra complexity?

How many posts per month are you realistically willing to publish for the first 6 months (minimum baseline)?
